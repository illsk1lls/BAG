USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION! 

The entire folder you use this in can be deleted if an error occurs. ALWAYS test single line BAG in its own folder.
ALWAYS test with COPIES of files and not originals when testing BAG. BAG deletes the file you drop after adding it to itself, because thats the point. 
You are putting the file IN the BAG. It is possible to lose the file you drop if an error occurs, so DO NOT test with original data that is not backed up.

USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION! 

Single line BAG is just for fun and a frivolous puzzle. A waste of time.. How much of the multi-line BAG can we get to run on a single line?? We may never know ;P
*For single line bag, at present NO SPACES OR SPECIAL CHARS ("()!@#$%^&*-+;:') in filenames/paths allowed.
